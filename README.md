## Hi there, I'm Christina 👋👋

### 🌱 I am a motivated and collaborative team player seeking to leverage 7 years of professional experience into a software engineering career. 

### 🔭 While working full-time, I completed my second bachelor's degree in Computer Science to pursue my passion in software engineering. I bring a strong and varied background of technical and soft skills from my previous experience as a technical writer and solutions engineer that I believe make me a valuable addition to any engineering team.

### 🎉 Fun Facts 🎉
- I have two cats who I adore, Bumper and Birdie 🐈 🐈
- 📖 I love reading -- I try to read <30 books a year, my favorite genres are Fantasy and Sci-Fi, recommend me a book!
- You can usually find me in the at the closest book store or in the gym 💪
